# 🗺️ Shortest Path Finder

An interactive pathfinding visualization tool that helps you understand graph traversal algorithms like **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**, **A* (A-Star)**, and **BFS/DFS**. This project visually demonstrates how different algorithms explore nodes and find the optimal path in a 2D grid.
